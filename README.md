## Problem Space
  
- massive amounts of data
- similarly structuresd
- similar domains
- makes it an easy candidate for graph processing*

## Goals

- Data Enrichment
- Easier manual and automated semantic navigation of large datasets
- Business Continuity
- Increase operational efficiency

## Conditions that Need to Be Met

## Mini WBS

- [ ] Create single api dag run

### Technologies

Semantic Data, REST APIs

## Service / Workflow Architectural Components

The core of this app, as is the core of a behemoth multitude of workflow automation apps and services, is Apache Airflow.

- Particularly in infosec and security automation
  1. Centralized workflow and logging
- giving way to centralized monitoring, efficient observability and monitoring. 

## Package structure

While conceptualizing, prototyping, and iterating over any solution implementations within a given problem-space, the simplest implementations are often most self-advised. This way, I can focus on a larger idea without losing bandwidth in any attemps to perfect some component implementation.
