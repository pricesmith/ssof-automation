## Problem Space

## Service / Workflow Architectural Components
The core of this app, as is the core of a behemoth multitude of workflow automation apps and services, is Apache Airflow. 
- Particularly in infosec and security automation
  - Centralized workflow and logging
  - giving way to centralized monitoring, efficient observability and monitoring. 

## Package structure
While conceptualizing, prototyping, and iterating over any solution implementations within a given problem-space, the simplest implementations are often most self-advised. This way, I can focus on a larger idea without losing bandwidth in any attemps to perfect some component implementation.
