- sifting through actionable solution proposals to any given problem-space in fintech cybersec.

- continuing work on narrowing down a problem space while considering particular technologies I both enjoy and believe are highy under-utilized for the flexibility of solution-tooling they offer -- will elaborate. 

#### 21:41 PST

- Feeling unrealistic expectations of wanting to POC something genuinely interesting. Granted, it's partly because I enjoy the discovery and learning phase. Definitely need to revert back to a solid and reliable example problem space. Can always research, plan, and iterate beyond. 

#### 21:49 PST

- decided to include stumbled-across, unrelated resources I find of interest. This is a general habit of mine that creates an enormous backlog of articles, websites, technologies, etc, that I would like to dip a toe into in some capacity. -- It has its pros and cons.

- Continue to glance at Ontology based security technologies. Whether I have enough time to sift through, transform, and load pertinent data into a triplestore is probably less of an issue than continuing to ensure that I keep to a solid problem space. Currently, I'm leaning toward at least starting by consolidating compromised software and software components/libraries/tools that would likely inform expedient updates. 

#### 22:48 PST

- Reading more into ontology models, usage, and tooling in the cybersecurity space along-side various threat modeling tools. 

#### 22:51 PST

- Learned what a CPE is.

#### 23:01 PST

- Learning a lot about NIST, NVE Database, and KEVs. Interested in possible data dransformations. Though I should certainly focus on exraction first.
