### 09/29

#### 21:01 PST

- sifting through actionable solution proposals to any given problem-space in fintech cybersec.

#### 29 | 21:26 PST

- continuing work on narrowing down a problem space while considering particular technologies I both enjoy and believe are highy under-utilized for the flexibility of solution-tooling they offer -- will elaborate. 

#### 21:41 PST

- Feeling unrealistic expectations of wanting to POC something genuinely interesting. Granted, it's partly because I enjoy the discovery and learning phase. Definitely need to revert back to a solid and reliable example problem space. Can always research, plan, and iterate beyond. 

#### 21:49 PST

- decided to include stumbled-across, unrelated resources I find of interest. This is a general habit of mine that creates an enormous backlog of articles, websites, technologies, etc, that I would like to dip a toe into in some capacity. -- It has its pros and cons.

#### 22:18 PST

- Continue to glance at Ontology based security technologies. Whether I have enough time to sift through, transform, and load pertinent data into a triplestore is probably less of an issue than continuing to ensure that I keep to a solid problem space. Currently, I'm leaning toward at least starting by consolidating compromised software and software components/libraries/tools that would likely inform expedient updates.

#### 22:48 PST

- Reading more into ontology models, usage, and tooling in the cybersecurity space along-side various threat modeling tools. 

#### 22:51 PST

- Learned what a CPE is.

#### 23:01 PST

- Learning a lot about NIST, NVE Database, and KEVs. Interested in possible data dransformations. Though I should certainly focus on exraction first. 

#### 23:14 PST

- Interested in the NIST NVE/KEV Database. Going to review Problem Space parameters (assumptions, use cases, consumers). If good, will start filling out the few resources being up until this point... other than eye strain.

### 09/30

#### 00:24 PST

- Got very tired and took a big walk. Wrote some notes on my phone that I will add shortly.

#### 02:00 PST

- Remembering more python. Slightly more sure of what I'd like to do with this... realistically.
- Remembering I can always do more with it later if it truly tickles my fancy.

#### 02:58 PST

- Excited about what these data sets offer. Going to lightly refactor the http client, document a bit more, and start working on the db impl. I'll likely go with DuckDB. I've always wanted to experiment with it, and it's optimized for OLAP data processing -- good for multidimensional analysis on large datasets. But first, a walk.

#### 03:30 PST

- Back from walk. Less do this.
- Refactoring http client, adding more in-line and readme documentation, setting up the db container and working with each api's schema.

#### 05:28 PST

- Using willpower to shift focus from reading/code to comprehensive documentation.

#### 07:59 PST

- Writing is slowing down due to overelaboration.

### 10/01

#### 11:31 PST

- Some re-evaluation. Re-breaking things down. Cleaning up documentation. Will update.

#### 13:06 PST

- Documenting CVE API taking forever. Will still need to reformat and refactor a bit.
